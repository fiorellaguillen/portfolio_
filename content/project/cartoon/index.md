title: Assessing the Risks: Cycling Accident Severity in London
summary: This research analyzes the spatial distribution of cycling accidents in London, classifying them by severity. The study employs Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to visualize high-risk areas and develops a ranking tool to identify the most dangerous intersections for cyclists, aiding in traffic safety prioritization. Additionally, a regression analysis reveals key factors influencing accident severity, highlighting an inverse correlation between severe accidents and rush hour occurrencesâ€”suggesting that time of day plays a critical role in accident severity patterns.
